   <p class="c2">Our school choir is a lovely, welcoming group of students, and we consider ourselves one big family!!
    The students are very talented and have great passion and commitment.
    Choir is great fun and allows students to form bonds with other students outside their year group.

    <br>There will be a musical showcase in the school on May 9th to raise money for a new piano. Tickets are &euro;5 for students and &euro;7 for adults. We are working very hard to prepare for it and would love if you could come along to support us!!</p>
