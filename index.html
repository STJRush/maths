                Entry Requirements:<br>
a Higher Certificate in Mathematics
or

a qualification of NFQ level 6 where Mathematics was taken as a major subject for two years,   
or

any other such qualification that the Institute may deem equivalent
                <br>
                Applications: <br>
Early application is encouraged.  As the number of places is limited, candidates may be short-listed on the basis of 
                information supplied on the application form. Late applications may be considered should vacancies remain.
                Candidates will be notified of the outcome or of any short-listing procedures.
               
                <br>
               Examinations:<br>
Continuous assessment counts for 30% of the final mark.  Examinations are held at the end of Semester 2. 
                <br>
               Learning Outcomes:<br>
On successfully completing the BSc (Ordinary), the learner will:<br>

have a good understanding of advanced concepts of Mathematical Methods, Algebra, Statistics and Numerical Methods,
be able to apply mathematical theory and techniques to solve a wide range of problems,
be able to employ several software packages to model and solve problems in the different areas covered
               <br>
                Career Opportunities: <br>
Career opportunities for graduates of a degree in mathematics are found in all sectors of employment.  It is an extremely
                flexible qualification and the mathematical, analytical and problem-solving skills that are learned are vital
                for modern roles in commerce, industry, business, the public sector and other professions.   At present,
                there are a wide range of opportunities for graduates in the ICT and financial sectors but the flexible 
                nature of a mathematics qualification allows graduates to change careers and embark upon new careers in
                emerging and rapidly growing sectors.  Mathematical skills are also important for upskilling and can enhance
                career progression in roles that rely on analytical approaches.   Graduates of the programme will also be 
                able to undertake further study in the School of Mathematical Sciences which offers a ladder of qualifications 
                including honours degrees, masters degrees and degrees by research.
